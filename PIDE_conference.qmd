## [Research Questions]{.hi-orange} {.left background-color="#264653"}

::: {.r-stretch}


### Whether our graduates are well equiped with skills for jobs of today and tomorrow?


### [What type of learning eco-system can enable higher education institutions to prepare graduates work ready and continuous learners]{.hi-orange}

##
[3rd decade of the 21st century is being characterized as the ‘Talent wars’ perhaps eclipsing the conflict for resources, ideology, territory etc. Talent flows to the highest bidder. Talent thrives in economic and competitive environments.]{.hi-orange}
Israel and Japan living examples of our times.

::: notes
First, the advancing digitalization of work has made
highly educated workers more productive and less-educated workers easier
to replace with machinery.

::: notes
The theory we are talking about states that a so-called "youth bulge", which describes an excess in the young population of a country, is the real (and main) hidden force behind political instability. The term was first used by Gary Fuller in 1995, then adopted by the renowned political scientist Samuel Huntington, and later extended and popularized by German sociologist and economist Gunnar Heinsohn in his book "Söhne und Weltmacht" (2003, new ed. 2019). The basic idea is that resources are limited and are owned and managed by (older) adults. This is also true for (political) power. Young people want a piece of the action. The bigger the imbalance, i.e. the more young people there are, the bigger the conflicts because more young people fight for their place in the economy and society.

## Reskilling and Upskilling

## The Work of the Future David Autor {background-color="#264653"}

> ### [Enabling workers to remain productive in a continuously evolving workplace requires empowering them with excellent skills programs at all stages of life---in primary and secondary schools, in vocational and college programs, and in ongoing adult training programs.]{.hi-orange}

. . .

::: callout-tip
## [According to Robert Solow (2022 Prefeace The Work of the Future)]{.hi-orange}

- ###  Maintaining a skilled and adaptable labor force : productivity.

- ###  Easy access to education can function as an equalizing factor, although it is pretty clear that it does not perform this function very well in the US.

## Challenges  {background-color="#264653"}

### **youth bulge, unemployment, low economic growth**

### [**Lower productivity, stagnant output**]{.hi-orange}

### **Traditional skills**

### [**Universities : Business as usual**]{.hi-orange}

### **Shift from old paradigm to new paradigm**

### [**New learning ecosystem**]{.hi-orange}


##  {background-color="#264653"}

-   **Chasm between skills required and skill prevailing**


-   **Digital revolution, gig economy and Silicon Valley era**


-   **Employers placing higher values on work ready graduates**


-   **Firms : buying talent instead of investing in talent**

. . .

### Questions 

::: {.r-stretch}


> [**What sort of skilling and reskilling may help our burgeoning young population and labor force to unlock its potential?**]{.hi-orange}

> [**How , what types and where long-term investment be made by the institutions in skilling, reskilling and upskilling of youth and working population should be made?**]{.hi-orange} 

:::


## Pakistan {background-color="#264653"}

-   **36% Pakistani Population under 14 years (WDI)**

-   **64% Pakistani Population under age 30 years**

-   **skill-biased technical change**

    -   [**Skill inequality gap**]{.hi-orange}


-   **Opportunities to excel but requires skills**

-   **25 million aged 17-25, universities catering 2.5-3 million**

-   **Skill inequality gap based on degree and its quality is huge**
